| Median | 62 |

### Individual HMR Times
- Run 1: 63ms
- Run 2: 61ms
- Run 3: 61ms
- Run 4: 76ms
- Run 5: 62ms


## Performance Assessment

**GOOD** - Fast hot-reload enables productive SolidJS development

## Success Rate
- Successful measurements: 5/5 (100%)

## Technical Details

### Development Stack
- **Framework**: SolidJS (latest)
- **Meta-Framework**: SolidStart
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SolidJS plugin
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Dev Server**: localhost:3000
- **HMR Engine**: Vite HMR + SolidJS Fast Refresh

### Measurement Method
- **File Modification**: Comment injection at component file start
- **Timing**: File save to processing completion
- **Test Type**: Synthetic TSX component changes with timestamp
- **Restoration**: Original content restored after each test

## Benchmark Context

### Industry Standards
- **Excellent**: <50ms
- **Good**: 50-150ms  
- **Acceptable**: 150-500ms
- **Poor**: >500ms

### SolidJS Advantages
- Fine-grained reactivity system
- No virtual DOM overhead
- Efficient compilation to vanilla JS
- Vite-powered development experience
- Fast refresh preserves component state

## Development Experience Impact

Fast hot-reload provides excellent developer experience with minimal waiting time between changes and feedback.

## SolidJS-Specific Features

### Reactive System Benefits
- **Fine-grained updates**: Only changed parts re-render
- **Compile-time optimizations**: Templates compiled to efficient DOM operations
- **No runtime overhead**: Reactive system compiled away
- **State preservation**: Component state maintained during HMR

### SolidStart Integration
- **Universal rendering**: SSR/SPA hybrid approach
- **File-based routing**: Automatic route generation
- **Build optimizations**: Optimized production bundles
- **Development features**: Enhanced dev server capabilities

## Optimization Recommendations

### For Current Performance
- Performance is excellent - no immediate optimizations needed
- Monitor performance as project grows
- SolidJS reactive system enables efficient updates
- Consider component composition strategies

## Framework Comparison Notes

### SolidJS vs React/Vue
- Similar component model but with true reactivity
- No virtual DOM means less computation overhead
- Smaller bundle sizes due to compilation approach
- Faster runtime performance with comparable dev experience

### SolidStart vs Next.js/Nuxt
- Similar meta-framework capabilities
- File-based routing and SSR support
- Vite-based development for fast rebuilds
- Emerging ecosystem but growing rapidly

## Notes
- Times measured from file modification to processing completion
- Test involves adding/removing comments to trigger recompilation
- Original file content is preserved throughout testing
- Multiple runs provide statistical reliability
- SolidJS preserves component state during hot reloads
- SolidStart provides full-stack development capabilities
