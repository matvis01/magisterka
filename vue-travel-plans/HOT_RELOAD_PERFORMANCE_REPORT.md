- Run 4: 61ms
- Run 5: 62ms


## Performance Assessment

**GOOD** - Fast hot-reload enables productive Vue development

## Success Rate
- Successful measurements: 5/5 (100%)

## Technical Details

### Development Stack
- **Framework**: Vue 3 (latest)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Vue plugin
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **Routing**: Vue Router
- **Dev Server**: localhost:5173
- **HMR Engine**: Vite HMR + Vue Fast Refresh

### Measurement Method
- **File Modification**: Comment injection at component file start
- **Timing**: File save to processing completion
- **Test Type**: Synthetic Vue SFC changes with timestamp
- **Restoration**: Original content restored after each test

## Benchmark Context

### Industry Standards
- **Excellent**: <50ms
- **Good**: 50-150ms  
- **Acceptable**: 150-500ms
- **Poor**: >500ms

### Vue 3 Advantages
- Composition API efficiency
- Proxy-based reactivity system
- Optimized virtual DOM
- Single File Component architecture
- Vite-powered development experience

## Development Experience Impact

Fast hot-reload provides excellent developer experience with minimal waiting time between changes and feedback.

## Vue-Specific Features

### Reactivity System Benefits
- **Proxy-based reactivity**: Efficient change detection
- **Composition API**: Flexible component logic
- **Single File Components**: Template, script, and style co-location
- **Fast Refresh**: State preservation during HMR

### Vite Integration
- **Lightning-fast cold starts**: ES modules in development
- **Instant hot updates**: Precise module invalidation
- **Optimized dependencies**: Pre-bundling for performance
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Rich development tooling

## Optimization Recommendations

### For Current Performance
- Performance is excellent - no immediate optimizations needed
- Monitor performance as project grows
- Vue's reactivity system enables efficient updates
- Consider component composition strategies

## Framework Comparison Notes

### Vue vs React/Angular
- Similar component-based architecture
- Proxy-based reactivity vs Virtual DOM/Zone.js
- Progressive framework approach
- Template syntax vs JSX/decorators

### Vue 3 vs Vue 2
- Composition API for better logic reuse
- Improved TypeScript support
- Better tree-shaking and bundle size
- Enhanced performance with proxy reactivity

## Notes
- Times measured from file modification to processing completion
- Test involves adding/removing Vue comments to SFC files
- Original file content is preserved throughout testing
- Multiple runs provide statistical reliability
- Vue preserves component state during hot reloads
- Single File Components enable efficient partial updates
