- Run 3: 108ms
- Run 4: 108ms
- Run 5: 109ms


## Performance Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - Very fast hot-reload for Ember framework

## Success Rate
- Successful measurements: 5/5 (100%)

## Technical Details

### Development Stack
- **Framework**: Ember.js (latest)
- **Build Tool**: Ember CLI
- **Template Engine**: Handlebars
- **Dev Server**: localhost:4200
- **File Watching**: Ember CLI's built-in file watcher

### Measurement Method
- **File Modification**: Handlebars comment injection at template start
- **Timing**: File save to processing completion
- **Test Type**: Synthetic template changes with timestamp
- **Restoration**: Original content restored after each test

## Benchmark Context

### Ember-Specific Standards
- **Excellent**: <200ms
- **Good**: 200-500ms  
- **Acceptable**: 500ms-1s
- **Poor**: >1s

### Ember CLI Features
- Convention-over-configuration approach
- Integrated build pipeline
- Template precompilation
- Automatic dependency management
- Addon system integration

## Development Experience Impact

The fast hot-reload enables efficient Ember development with quick visual feedback. Template changes are reflected rapidly, supporting productive development flow.

## Optimization Recommendations

### For Current Performance
- Performance is good for Ember framework standards
- Monitor performance as project grows
- Consider template optimization strategies
- Review addon dependencies impact

## Framework Comparison Notes

### Ember vs Modern Bundlers
- Ember CLI prioritizes stability and convention over raw speed
- Template precompilation adds overhead but improves runtime performance
- Addon ecosystem may impact build times
- More mature build pipeline with established patterns

### Development Workflow
- Changes to Handlebars templates trigger template recompilation
- Component updates may require broader rebuilds
- Route changes typically need full application refresh
- Service modifications propagate through dependency graph

## Notes
- Times measured from file modification to processing completion
- Test involves adding/removing Handlebars comments
- Original file content is preserved throughout testing
- Multiple runs provide statistical reliability
- Ember CLI's file watching handles template updates
