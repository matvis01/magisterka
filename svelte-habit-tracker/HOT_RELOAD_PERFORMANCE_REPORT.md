**Framework:** Svelte + SvelteKit + Vite  
**Measurement Date:** 2025-08-26 19:52:16  
**Test Runs:** 5  
**Test File:** src\lib\components\WeekView.svelte

## Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Performance

| Metric | Time (ms) |
|--------|-----------|
| Average | 66 |
| Minimum | 60 |
| Maximum | 77 |
| Median | 61 |

### Individual HMR Times
- Run 1: 77ms
- Run 2: 61ms
- Run 3: 61ms
- Run 4: 60ms
- Run 5: 71ms


## Performance Assessment

**GOOD** - Fast hot-reload enables productive Svelte development

## Success Rate
- Successful measurements: 5/5 (100%)

## Technical Details

### Development Stack
- **Framework**: Svelte (latest)
- **Meta-Framework**: SvelteKit
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Svelte plugin
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Dev Server**: localhost:5173
- **HMR Engine**: Vite HMR + Svelte Hot Reload

### Measurement Method
- **File Modification**: Comment injection at component file start
- **Timing**: File save to processing completion
- **Test Type**: Synthetic Svelte component changes with timestamp
- **Restoration**: Original content restored after each test

## Benchmark Context

### Industry Standards
- **Excellent**: <50ms
- **Good**: 50-150ms  
- **Acceptable**: 150-500ms
- **Poor**: >500ms

### Svelte Advantages
- Compile-time optimizations
- No virtual DOM overhead
- Efficient reactive updates
- Small runtime footprint
- Vite-powered development experience

## Development Experience Impact

Fast hot-reload provides excellent developer experience with minimal waiting time between changes and feedback.

## Svelte-Specific Features

### Compilation Benefits
- **Compile-time analysis**: Templates compiled to efficient vanilla JS
- **No runtime framework**: Svelte disappears at build time
- **Reactive statements**: Automatic dependency tracking
- **Component isolation**: Scoped styles and logic

### SvelteKit Integration
- **Full-stack framework**: SSR, routing, and build optimization
- **File-based routing**: Automatic route generation
- **Adapters**: Deploy to various platforms
- **Development features**: Enhanced dev server and debugging

## Optimization Recommendations

### For Current Performance
- Performance is excellent - no immediate optimizations needed
- Monitor performance as project grows
- Svelte's compilation approach enables efficient updates
- Consider component composition strategies

## Framework Comparison Notes

### Svelte vs React/Vue
- Compiled approach vs runtime framework
- No virtual DOM vs virtual DOM diffing
- Smaller bundle sizes due to compilation
- Different mental model but similar component patterns

### SvelteKit vs Next.js/Nuxt
- Similar meta-framework capabilities
- File-based routing and SSR support
- Vite-based development for fast rebuilds
- Compile-time optimizations for better performance

## Notes
- Times measured from file modification to processing completion
- Test involves adding/removing Svelte comments
- Original file content is preserved throughout testing
- Multiple runs provide statistical reliability
- Svelte preserves component state during hot reloads
- SvelteKit provides full-stack development capabilities
