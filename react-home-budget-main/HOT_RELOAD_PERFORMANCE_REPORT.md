## Performance Assessment

**GOOD** - Fast hot-reload enables productive development

## Success Rate
- Successful measurements: 5/5 (100%)

## Technical Details

### Development Stack
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.0
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1
- **TypeScript**: Yes
- **Dev Server**: localhost:5173
- **HMR Engine**: Vite Fast Refresh

### Measurement Method
- **File Modification**: Comment injection at file start
- **Timing**: File save to processing completion
- **Test Type**: Synthetic file changes with timestamp
- **Restoration**: Original content restored after each test

## Benchmark Context

### Industry Standards
- **Excellent**: <50ms
- **Good**: 50-150ms  
- **Acceptable**: 150-500ms
- **Poor**: >500ms

### Vite Advantages
- Lightning-fast cold starts
- Instant hot module replacement
- Optimized dependency pre-bundling
- Precise invalidation

## Development Experience Impact

Fast hot-reload provides excellent developer experience with minimal waiting time between changes and feedback.

## Optimization Recommendations

### For Current Performance
- Performance is excellent - no immediate optimizations needed
- Monitor performance as project grows
- Consider performance budgets for larger codebases

## Notes
- Times measured from file modification to processing completion
- Test involves adding/removing comments to trigger recompilation
- Original file content is preserved throughout testing
- Multiple runs provide statistical reliability
- Vite's Fast Refresh preserves React state during updates
